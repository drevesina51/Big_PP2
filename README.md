## Description

**"Stribog"** is a cryptographic algorithm for calculating a hash function with an input data block size of 512 bits and a hash code size of 256 or 512 bits.

### Concepts for constructing the hash function "Stribog"

* The new hash function must not have properties that would allow known attacks to be applied;

* The hash function must use the studied constructs and transformations;

* The calculation of the hash function must be efficient and take little time;

* There should be no unnecessary transformations that complicate the construction of the hash function. Moreover, each transformation used in the hash function must be responsible for certain cryptographic properties.

#### **The detailed operating principle can be found directly in [GOST](https://github.com/drevesina51/images/blob/main/1200095035.pdf)**
